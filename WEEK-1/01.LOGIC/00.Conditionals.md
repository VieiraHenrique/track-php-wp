# Conditionals

---

When we talk about conditionals we obviously have to take in account the `logical operators`.

Nothing new here...

```
<   Less than
>   Greater than
<=  Less than or equal to
>=  Greater than or equal to
==  Equal to
=== Identical to
!=  Not equal to
!== Not identical to

```

And to be honest... nothing new in the conditional as well :

```php
$glycemia = 135;

$diabetes_limit = 100;

if ($glycemia > $diabetes_limit){
    echo "You have diabetes";
} else if ($glycemia < $diabetes_limit){
    echo "You are ok !";
} else {
    echo "No diabetes yet, but be very carefull !";
}

```

Other example using dates.

```php

$my_arr = [3, 8, "Hello"];

if (!empty($my_arr)){
    echo "There are elements in the array";
} else {
    echo "Nothing to show";
}

// Yet anothe native function (empty) ! There are so many !!!!
```

Ternary operators will work as well :

```php
echo !empty($my_arr) ? "There are elements in the array" : "Nothing to show;
```

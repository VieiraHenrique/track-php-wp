**Let's do an exercise !**

---

**1.**

Given this associative array, output what is demanded :

```php

$cities_by_country = [
    "Belgium" => "Brussels",
    "Belgium" => "LiÃ¨ge",
    "France" => "Paris",
    "Belgium" => "Charleroi",
    "Italy" => "Rome",
    "France" => "Nice",
    "Brazil" => "Rio de Janeiro",
    "Belgium" => "Antwerp",

]
```

Output a list (ul > li) of all the cities located in Belgium from this array.

Use a combination of loop and conditional.

- For that, go learn first how to imbricate PHP with HTML
- Then, go find what the directives `endforeach` and `endif` do.

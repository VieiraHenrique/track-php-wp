**Let's do some exercises !**

**1.**

Let's say a visitor entered his bank account on our website : `N957324`

We know (in this example) that a bank account should be 7 digits.

- Print how many digits this account number contains.

Let's say the first letter means "N" for "national" and "I" for international.

- Print the first letter of the bank account. In this format : `The first letter of the bank account is N` (using the variable)

Now let's say the first two letters means which country the bank account is from. `BE97684531265`

- Print from which country this bank account is in this format : `This bank account is from BE` (using the variable)

Let's say all bank accounts from the website have an underscore `_` after the `BE` and we need to get rid of it in order to properly process it in our program.

- From this string :

```php
"   BE_954364     "
```

(pay attention to the empty spaces before and after) print : `The account number is BE954364`

**2.**

I've provided you with a word variable, set to `skateboard`. Your goal is to use string functions on `$word`, so that you end up with the string `"beard"`.

- Use a string method to extract the "board" part of "skateboard"

- Replace the "o" in board with an "e"

- Save the result in a variable called `facial_hair` and then print it.

```php
// DON'T TOUCH THIS LINE! (please)
$word = "skateboard"; //Don't change this line!

// YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:

```

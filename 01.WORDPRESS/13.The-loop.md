# The Loop

---

Often, when we start learning WordPress we begin with `The Loop`, a basic strategy to display all the blog posts we have in our website. The reason we didn't do it here is because I prefered to show how to create a **showcase website** before. Not a problem ! Let's see how we can incorporate a list of our posts in our main page and then be able to click on them to go to their specific page.

But first... Let's see some native WordPress functions that are used very often to retrieve a post information.

`the_title`, `the_content`, `the_date`, `the_permalink`, etc.

These functions echo the title of the post, its content, the date of publication, the link to the page, etc.

Let's try to understando some concepts...

Remember I told you everything in WordPress is considered as a post ? Even a page is treated as post. So, these functions are gonna echo the title of the "post" (even if it's a page), the date the "post" was published, the permalink (the link/url of the page/post basically), etc.

Try for yourself!

In `home.php` (the page you created at the begin), you should have something like this :

![alt text](image-11.png)

- Now, erase the hard coded `HOME PAGE` and, in php, call `the_title()`

- Now, insert this :

  ```php
  <p> Date of publication :
  <?php
    $date = get_the_date();
    echo $date;
  ?>
  </p>
  ```

See ? You have the date of `publication` of the page. (When you created it)

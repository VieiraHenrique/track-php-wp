# Intro to WordPress

**WordPress** is the main tool for website creation in the world. It's estimated that 43.1% of the internet websites are powered by it.

At its Core: WordPress is a free and open-source **Content Management System** (CMS). That means it provides a user-friendly dashboard with tools that make it easy to create, remove and maintain the content of a website.

WordPress is built primarily with the programming language PHP and uses a database (usually MySQL) to store all your website's content.

Let's try to understand this even further with some points :

Let's say you have a website. Of course this website has content (texts, images, etc.). As you know, the texts of a website live inside the HTML code. And images are references to either local images in the folder of you website or a link to some external image. (these references are ultimately texts inside your HTML as well)

Let's say you want to update or insert new content into a page... what would you do ? One way is to get back to your code and change the texts inside of it. This is the hard way. Not efficient at all.

Everytime you want to make a small change in your website you'll have to get back to your code and redeploy your website ?

There's got a be a better way ! Is there ?

Well... I am glad you asked ! Of course there is !

A CMS has exactly this purpose : a way of maintaing your website without going through the code.

It usually uses a user-friendly dashboard, where you'll have fields that can be populated with your content.

Your code will have to be ready to communicate with these fields, and when a request is done to your page, the server fetches these information from the database to populate the HTML that it will serve.

Remember : PHP is a server side language, so it checks the program you wrote in PHP, then it compiles it to HTML.

So, if you have a code like this :

```php
<p>
 <?php echo "Hello"; ?>
</p>
```

Your HTML page will be :

```html
<p>Hello</p>
```

Well... if instead of having `echo "hello";` you have something like `echo (SOMETHING FROM THE DATABASE)`

PHP will fetch first what is in the database before compiling it to HTML.

Which meeeeans.... If via your WordPress dashboard you add some text that is then automatically saved to the database, you'll have a dynamic compilation of your content on the fly by the server with the content you entered in your dashboard.

GREAT !!!!

I hope you already have a grasp on the power of a CMS.

Let's install WordPress and get to know how its dashboard works...

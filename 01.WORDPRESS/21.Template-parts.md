# Template parts

---

Small chapter to make you know that there is such a thing called "template parts" in WordPress.

Template parts are reusable sections of content that you can incorporate into different templates across your site. They function like building blocks, simplifying website development and maintenance.

#### Functionality:

**Modular Design:** Template parts break down your website's layout into manageable pieces, like headers, footers, sidebars, or specific content areas.

**Reusable Components:** Once you create a template part, you can insert it into various page templates throughout your site. This eliminates the need to copy and paste the same code in multiple locations.

**Simplified Editing:** If you need to make a change to a reusable section, you only need to modify the template part file itself. This saves time and ensures consistency across your entire website.

#### How to Use Them (Block Themes):

**Access:** Template parts are primarily a feature of WordPress block themes. You can access them through the WordPress dashboard by navigating to Appearance > Editor > Template Parts.

**Pre-built Parts:** Most block themes come with pre-built template parts for common sections like headers and footers.

**Creating New Parts:** You can also create custom template parts to suit your specific needs. These parts will use block editor blocks to define the layout and content.

**Inserting Parts:** To include a template part within a page template, you'll use the Template Part block. This block allows you to select the specific template part you want to insert.

#### Overall Benefits:

**Improved Workflow:** Template parts streamline website development by making it faster and easier to build and modify page layouts.

**Reduced Redundancy:** They eliminate the need for repetitive code, keeping your theme files clean and organized.

**Consistent Design:** By making changes in one central location, you can ensure a consistent look and feel throughout your website.

If you're working with a block theme in WordPress, template parts are a valuable tool to enhance your website development and design process.

Try for yourself :

- Create a template part with a banner (you can just create a little text, don't need to do css. We'll do this later in the project)
- For now, hard code some text for the banner. Don't use ACF.
- Include it to the `Movies` and `Actors` pages.

# A little summary

---

Oufff... Let's try to make sense on what we've been doing...

Here is a small recap of the concepts we tackled.

- WordPress is originally a **blog engine** that considers everything as a blog post.

- That means... every post (or even page) has an author, a publication date, the ability to comment, etc.

- We can assign posts and pages to **templates** which are regular HTML pages in order to display these posts. But we often won't be displaying posts. Just a regular website page. Which brings us to the next point :

- Creating a regular website from scratch and use WordPress to power it as a CMS is a constant _hack_ to use the power of customization of WordPress without having to consider it a blog.

- This power comes from the ability of inserting content: text, images, etc., keep them in sync with a database, edit them, etc. from a single Dashboard.

- More than the regular WYSIWYG you can use for a blog post, we have also the possibility to create custom fields and name them in order to have a proper _editing structure_ in our dashboard. (A plugin such as ACF is wonderfully easy and usefull to that).

# Pagination

---

Ok... This subject is a little anoying... :(
At the end, we ask ourselves why couldn't it be easier ? But that's the way it is. Buckle up !

---

You should now have created the pages `Movies` and `Actors`. In each of these pages, you queried their specifc post types and looped through it to display each one of them.

Now... let's say you have hundreds of movies to display. That would be a very looooong page.

The solution ? Pagination !

Thankfully, WordPress gets us covered, event though it could be more intuitive... :/

---

Everything is gonna happen on the WP Query you'll write, with the properties `posts_per_page` and `paged`.

You already know that you must assign `posts_per_page` to `-1` to get all the entries. But limiting the amount of posts will give you the ability to retrieve only some posts and navigate through different pages that you define with `paged`.

Try for yourself !

- With the 10 movies you created, make a query with only 3 movies per page.
- You'll see that only the 3 last published posts will be displayed.
- Now, if you set `paged` to 2 (page 2 of the pagination) you will get the next 3 movies.
- Now, try to enter in the url `{your url}/page/3`
  - See ? It doesn't give you any error. This URL exists ! (but nothing changes in what is displayed)

We are going to play with this !

Instead of having hard coded the `paged` attribute (like "3"), we are going to assign it to a variable that we are going to create that captures the number of the URL.

And there is a function to this ! `get_query_var('paged');`

Try to make sense of this snippet :

```php
$current_page = get_query_var('paged');
// The only problem with the code above is that when we are in the first page, for some reason, it considers to be the page 0 instead of 1. We can solve that with :

$current_page =  (get_query_var('paged')) ? get_query_var('paged') : 1;
// Do you get why ? If paged is not 0, it says like it is. If it is, it goes to 1.

$args = array(
    'post_type'         => 'movie',
    'posts_per_page'    =>  3,
    'paged'             =>  $current_page,
);
```

`$current_page` here is the number in your url. So... If your url is `{your url}/page/4`, your query will have the `paged` argument as 4 !

Now you should be able to change the url with different numbers and see that the movies that appear are different.

Untill now, it's ok. Not that hard. But what's missing ?

The ability to navigate back and forward to these urls without having to change directly the url by hand.

You could try to implement the logic to do that with some of these native functions :

```

```

Well... my friends... I won't tell you this often, but

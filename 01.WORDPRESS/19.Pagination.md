# Pagination

---

You should now have created the pages `Movies` and `Actors`. In each of these pages, you queried their specifc post types and looped through it to display each one of them.

Now... let's say you have hundreds of movies to display. That would be a very looooong page.

The solution ? Pagination !

Thankfully, WordPress has a very easy way to implement it.

---

Everything is gonna happen on the WP Query you'll write, with the property `posts_per_page`.

You already know that you must assign it to `-1` to get all the entries. But limiting the amount of posts will give you the ability to retrieve only some posts and navigate through different pages.

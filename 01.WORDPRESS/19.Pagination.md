# Pagination

---

You should now have created the pages `Movies` and `Actors`. In each of these pages, you queried their specifc post types and looped through it to display each one of them.

Now... let's say you have hundreds of movies to display. That would be a very looooong page.

The solution ? Pagination !

Thankfully, WordPress has a very easy way to implement it.

Everything is gonna happen on the WP Query you'll write, with the properties `posts_per_page` and `paged`.

You already know that you must assign `posts_per_page` to `-1` to get all the entries. But limiting the amount of posts will give you the ability to retrieve only some posts and navigate through different pages that you define with `paged`.

Try for yourself !

- With the 10 movies you created, make a query with only 3 movies per page.
- You'll see that only the 3 last published will be displayed.
- Now, if you set `paged` to 2 (page 2 of the pagination) you will get the next 3 movies.

The missing piece here is to be able to have links to navigate through the pages.

In order to do that, there are some manipulations to be done.

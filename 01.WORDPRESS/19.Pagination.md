# Pagination

---

You should now have created the pages `Movies` and `Actors`. In each of these pages, you queried their specifc post types and looped through it to display each one of them.

Now... let's say you have hundreds of movies to display. That would be a very looooong page.

The solution ? Pagination !

Thankfully, WordPress has a very easy way to implement it.

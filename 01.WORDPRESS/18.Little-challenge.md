# Little challenge

---

From the little project we created in the last chapter, do the following :

- Create several movies and actors (10 of each, for example.)

- In the `homepage` display only 3 of each under the title ("Movies" and "Actors")
- Make these titles clickable and this will lead to another page `Movies` and a page `Actors` with the list of all the movies / actors.
- From there you can click on any movie / actor and go to their single page.
- If you are up to it, try to find a way of creating pagination. We will see this later but you can already try. ;)

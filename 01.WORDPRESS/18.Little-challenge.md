# Little challenge

---

From the little project we created in the last chapter, do the following :

- Create several movies and actors in the dahsboard (10 of each, for example.)

- In the `homepage` display only 3 of each under the titles ("Movies" and "Actors")
- Create a menu with links to two other pages you'll have to create : `Movies` and `Actors` where you'll have the whole list of movies / actors.
- If you are up to it, try to find a way of creating pagination. We will see this later but you can already try. ;)
- From there you can click on any movie / actor and go to their single page.

(here, you'll find a problem... the `single.php` file is configured by WordPress to display the single pages of the post type `post`. Find a way to display the single pages of `movie` and `actor` respectively)

(ok... let me tell you... `single-movie.php` will automatically look for the post type `movie`, but shhhh... don't tell anyone I told you. ;) )

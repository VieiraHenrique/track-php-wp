# Taxonomy

---

There are some minor things missing to our application.

For example: the ability to **tag** and create **categories** for our posts which can be very helpful for searching and filtering our many entries.

These are what we call `Taxonomy`.

In WordPress, taxonomy acts as a classification system for organizing your content. It's like a filing cabinet for your posts, allowing you to group related items together. This enhances navigation for both users and search engines.

**What is the goal here ?**

- Be able to click in several tags in the "Movies" page (and "Actors" page as well) so you display only the movies/actors that belong to the tag you chose.

#### Hierarchical vs. Non-Hierarchical taxonomies:

**Categories**: Hierarchical, allowing for parent-child relationships. For example, "News" could be a parent category with child categories like "World News" and "Local News."

**Tags**: Non-hierarchical. Tags are associated keywords that describe a post's content, but they don't have a parent-child structure.

---

As custom post types or even custom fields, you can create tags and categories in your `functions.php`.

But why botter ? The amazing plugin ACF can do that for you !

(Although, if you're interested in knowing how to do it by yourself, I strongly encourage you to check it out !)

Let's try to understand how these work ;)

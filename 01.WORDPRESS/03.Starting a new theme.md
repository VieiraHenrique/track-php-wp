# Starting a new theme.

---

In your explorer, navigate to the folder where the themes are.

Delete all of them. (If you go back to your dashboard, you'll se they don't exist anymore.)

Now, create a new folder inside the `themes` folder. Name it as you wish to name your theme (most likely the name of your website.)

If you try to check the themes available now, you'll see it recognize there is a theme but it's not completed.

You will need to create several files with some instructions in them to set the theme up.

**That's a thing to know about WordPress:** it expects many files and instructions that have to be exactly named and placed by the WordPress conventions so it can detect them to make it work.

You'll also see that there are many and many and many `native functions` from WordPress that are needed to make a theme function properly.

It's like a framework with several rules you will have to respect.

Here is the most basic list of files you need to have inside your theme folder to make a theme functional :

- index.php
- style.css

That's it !
Inside of the style.css you will have to make a multi-line comment with `Theme Name`. As such :

```css
/*
    Theme Name: myThemeName
*/
```

This comment is the ID card of your theme. You can write many other info about your theme like: `author`, `version`, `description`, etc.

Go look for all the info you can add to this comment.

Ok... that's the BEAR MINIMUM !

Your theme can now be activated, and your site will be a blank page.

If you want to print a Hello World to your site, go to the index.php file and write down `Hello World`. Refresh your browser, and see your good work. Now you have a website !

Thank you so much for following this track and I hope you will be an awesome WordPress developer.

Bye bye, my friends !

Of course I am joking. Let's continue !

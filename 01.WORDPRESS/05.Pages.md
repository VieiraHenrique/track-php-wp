# Pages

---

Let's start with a `home` page.

In any page you create, you must start with a php comment :

```php
<?php /* Template Name: Home */ ?>
```

This is how WordPress will understand that this PHP file (ultimately an HTML) will be showed when you link this template to a page in the admin.

Speaking of... let's get back to the admin in order to do that.

---

- In the wp-admin, create a page and call it `home`
- Give it a name and associate the template to the name of the template you created (in this case : `home` as well)
- Now, you'll have to establish in WordPress that the homepage of your website will be a `static page` instead of your latest post (yet again, a "blog" engine legacy).
- Then select the WordPress page you want to display as your static home page. (`home`)
- In the code, write down some content in the template you created.
- Check you browser : There is your homepage !

Next, we will be implementing a custom header and footer that we can call in each of our pages (or not... as you whish ;))

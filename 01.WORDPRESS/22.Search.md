# Search

---

The ability to search a post or a page in a big website is crucial !

Fortunately, WordPress makes it very easy to implement with its pre-configured template and serach input.

In this template, you'll have to be able to get the results, display them and create the proper links to access them.

Try for yourself :

- Find the way to "call" the native search input of WordPress in your `header.php`.

- When you search for a term in this input, you will be redirected to a specific template that analyzes the searched term. Find out which template it is.

- In this search template, get to retrieve all the results and display them in a loop.

- Don't show all the content, just the title and the excerpt (and the cover picture if you decided to include them in your posts).

- Make it clickable so we can directly go to its single page.

Tips :

`get_search_query()`
args --> "s"

Nice feature isn't it ?

But... (there is always a but...) we have a little problem here : The results will match only if it's the exact term. Wouldn't it be nice to get partials matches as well ?

Let's see this in the next chapter !

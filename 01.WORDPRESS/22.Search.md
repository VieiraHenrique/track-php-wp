# Search

---

The ability to search a post or a page in a big website is crucial !

Fortunately, WordPress makes it very easy to implement with its pre-configured template and serach input.

In this template, you'll have to be able to get the results, display them and create the proper links to access them.

Try for yourself :

- Find the way to "call" the native search input of WordPress in your `header.php`.

- When you search for a term in this input, you will be redirected to a specific template that analyzes the searched term. Find out which template it is.

- In this search template, get to retrieve all the results and display them in a loop.

- Don't show all the content, just the title and the excerpt (and the cover picture if you decided to include them in your posts).

- Make it clickable so we can directly go to its single page.

Tips :

`get_search_query()`
args --> "s"

Nice feature isn't it ?

```php
get_search_form() // Will insert an input with a button to search that automatically redirects to the "search.php" template and creates a query string in the URL

////////////

// Access the submitted search term from the GET request
$search_term = isset($_GET['s']) ? sanitize_text_field($_GET['s']) : '';

// If search term is not empty, create a WP_Query
if (!empty($search_term)) {
    $args = array(
        's' => $search_term, // Search term from the form
    );

    $query = new WP_Query($args);

    // Loop through the search results and display them
    if ($query->have_posts()) {
        while ($query->have_posts()) {
            $query->the_post();
            the_title();
        }
    } else {
        echo 'No results found for your search term.';
    }

    // Reset post data after the loop
    wp_reset_postdata();
}

We already did a project during the training (the movie app we've been working on), but without any style or more specific features.

You are ready now to tackle a nice project with beautiful design that will be provided to you via Figma.

I highly recommend to create toroughly this new website from scratch in order to have a good practice and put it on your portfolio.

Honestly : very nice project to have in a portofolio (nice css, some JS logic, authentication, search capabilities, everything powered by WordPress...) to really impress your future employer.

Take a week (or may be a little less/more) to develop this SUPER PROJECT !!! Do it with perfection ! I know you can !

Find the project in the next folder.

### Further study

WordPress has a LOT more to offer than what we covered. We really can do anything with it ! But this is a really nice base to have a fullstack project.

(Plus: It's veeeeery easy to deploy a WordPress website in the web through the multiple hosts that provide this service. And it's cheap !)

Here are some further studies you could do by yourself in order to go even further :

- Create a register page in the frontend (it's more complicated than a login page)
- Create a CRUD operation from within your frontend so users can create, edit and delete posts without having to go to the dashboard.
- Or... Customize the dashboard so users that are not admin can't mess with it. (Giving them only the ability to create posts, edit and delete, etc.)
- Be able to call APIs from within your code and use AJAX with PHP in WordPress (but you also can do this with JS if you want)
- With this API call, creating post programatically from the data you receive from the API.

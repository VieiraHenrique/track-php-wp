# Authentication

From our past experience with backend, we know authentication can be a very tricky and slow process. We have to deal with tokens, cookies, etc.

WordPress, as always, gives you tons of tools to check if the user is logged in, if it's an admin, etc.

So... What is our goal here with this chapter ? Very simply introduce you to the management of authentication status on our frontend. We will be "protecting" some pages in order that only logged in users can access them.

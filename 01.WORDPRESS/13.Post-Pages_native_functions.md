# Post/page native functions

---

Let's see some native WordPress functions that are used very often to retrieve a post information. (we call them `template tags`)

`Template tags` are used within themes to retrieve content from your database. The content could be anything from a blog title to the whole content from inside the default WYSIWYG.

`the_title`, `the_content`, `the_date`, `the_permalink`, etc.

These functions echo the title of the post, its content (from the default WYSIWYG), the date of publication, the link to the page, etc.

Let's try to understando some concepts...

Remember I told you everything in WordPress is considered as a post ? Even a page is treated as a post. So, these functions are going to echo the title of the "post" (even if it's a page), the date the "post" was published, the permalink (the link/url of the page/post basically), etc.

Of course, it will display the title of the post of the page you are working on in your code.

Try for yourself!

In `home.php` (the page you created at the begin), you should have something like this :

![alt text](image-11.png)

- Now, erase the hard coded `HOME PAGE` and, in php, call `the_title()` (You'll see echoed the title of the page you created on the Dashboard)

- Now, insert this :

  ```php
  <p> Date of publication :
  <?php
    $date = get_the_date();
    echo $date;
  ?>
  </p>
  ```

See ? You have the date of `publication` of the page. (The day you created it)

There are tons and tons of WordPress native functions. [Here](https://wp-kama.com/handbook/cheatsheet) is a pretty neat cheat cheet with plenty of them. (for the subject we're talking right now, go see the `The Loop` section)

You should have noticed that when you are in a page and you call `the_title`, you'll echo the title of this specific page and not from another one. But there is gotta be a way to retrieve the title, date of publication, content, permalink, etc. from other pages/posts from within a specifc page, shouldn't it ?

Well.. of course we can do this ! This will be done through what we call `WP Queries`.

But first, let's tackle a little challenge.

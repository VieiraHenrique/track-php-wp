# Post/page native functions

---

Let's see some native WordPress functions that are used very often to retrieve a post information. (we call them `template tags`)

`Template tags` are used within themes to retrieve content from your database. The content could be anything from a blog title to the whole content from inside the default WYSIWYG.

`the_title`, `the_content`, `the_date`, `the_permalink`, etc.

These functions echo the title of the post, its content, the date of publication, the link to the page, etc.

Let's try to understando some concepts...

Remember I told you everything in WordPress is considered as a post ? Even a page is treated as a post. So, these functions are gonna echo the title of the "post" (even if it's a page), the date the "post" was published, the permalink (the link/url of the page/post basically), etc.

Of course, it will display the title of the post of the page you are working on in your code.

Try for yourself!

In `home.php` (the page you created at the begin), you should have something like this :

![alt text](image-11.png)

- Now, erase the hard coded `HOME PAGE` and, in php, call `the_title()` (You'll see echoed the title of the page you created on the Dashboard)

- Now, insert this :

  ```php
  <p> Date of publication :
  <?php
    $date = get_the_date();
    echo $date;
  ?>
  </p>
  ```

See ? You have the date of `publication` of the page. (When you created it)

There are tons and tons of WordPress native functions. [here](https://wp-kama.com/handbook/cheatsheet) is a pretty neat cheat cheet with plenty of them. (for the subject we talked right now, go see the `The Loop` section)

Let's use these template tags to display the posts we have in our website, but first... we need to understand what WP Queries are !

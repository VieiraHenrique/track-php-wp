# Single page

---

In our challenge, the link to a specific post led us to a blank page.
This is because we don't have a template for single pages.

The template is a reserved name file called `single` that must be in the root folder. (such as Header and Footer, WordPress interprets them automatically).

Try for yourself !

- Create a `single.php` in the root folder.
- Put `the_title()` in it
- Now open each article from the links in the homepage and see the magic !

Get it ?
It works like a regular template that will be automatically assigned to the particular post you are in.

- Create the template (with the header, footer)
- Create a link to come back to the homepage.
- Display all the infos you can think of from the post : featured image, title, content, author, date of publication, categories, tags... (Find in the dashboard a way to create categories and tags and assign different ones to each article)
- After this, try to get rid of the default WYSIWYG of the post (like you did to the pages) and create some custom fields to better structure the articles as you whish.
- Do the experimentation of setting a "custom" WYSIWYG from ACF --> see how the markup is implemented and create some CSS to customize the appearence of the different "styles" you enter in the WYSIWYG (bold, italic, etc.)

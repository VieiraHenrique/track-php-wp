# Single page

---

In our challenge, the link to a specific post led us to a blank page.
This is because we don't have a template for single pages.

The template is a reserved name file called `single` that must be in the root folder. (such as Header and Footer, WordPress interprets them automatically).

Try for yourself !

- Create a `single.php` in the root folder.
- Put `the_title()` in it
- Now open each article from the links in the homepage and see the magic !

Get it ?
It works like a regular template that will be automatically assigned to the particular post you are in.

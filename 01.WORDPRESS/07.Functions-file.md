# Functions file

---

The `functions.php` file - located at the root of your project - is a central player in your WordPress theme. It's where you will most likely write all logical code to customize your site.

In practice, `functions.php` is a file that **runs on every request** that is done to your site. Actually, it's the very **first file loaded by your theme**. It's therefore present in all your pages.

Of course, you won't be printing/rendering any text or markup from this file - as it's dedicated to the logical part of your theme. But, as a test, you can echo some `hello world` text in it and check that, indeed, it appears on your page even though it's not in your `header`, `footer` or `page` file. (It appears in the very beggining because it's the first file loaded).

So many things can be done from within `functions.php` ! You can configure/edit/overwrite virtually anything in your theme. In the front part, but also to the dashboard/database, etc. You can even make API calls from it and then populate the database with the results. That's just one use-case.

Let's start simple and add some WordPress hooks (functions from the WordPress program) so we can see how it affects our theme or dashboard.

There are two main kinds of hooks in WordPress :

- **Actions**: These allow you to execute code at specific points in the code execution, often used for tasks like adding content or modifying data.

- **Filters**: These let you alter existing data before it's used by WordPress, often used for tasks like changing the content displayed on a page or modifying form data.

**ASSIGNMENTS**

**1.**
Have you noticed that when you are in your frontend page in your browser there is this annoying admin bar on top ? That's because you are logged-in as the admin. If you don't need it (who needs this ???) you can overwrite this behaviour in the `functions.php` file.

- Go look for the WordPress hook that does that and get rid of this bar, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD !!!!

**2.**
Have you noticed that, in your dashboard, the pages you create have kind of a WYSIWYG text area where you can create content for your page ? This is mainly for people that don't create their theme by themselves. We don't need that once we will be adding custom fields depending on our needs.

- Go look for a way of getting rid of all this mess. We want a virgin page without any options.

**3.**

Let's do a little experiment... As you can see, there is no style applied to your site for now.

- Make background page `#eaeaea`
- Make the title in the header `blue`
- Make the main content text `bold`
- Make the footer `red`

**no inline-style!!**
**don't call a stylesheet from your head boilerplate**

Tip :

- You'll see very quickly that your first reflex does not work.
- Look for how you can add stylesheet to your head through WordPress (that means : it will be automatically injected to the `<head>` by WordPress thanks to the native function `wp_head()` )
- Ultimately, try to understand each parameters you use to do so.

See how you can customize and act on all sort of things ? This is the power of `functions.php` !

We will defintely get back to this file later. Buckle up !

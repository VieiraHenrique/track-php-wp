_Advanced Custom Fields_ is a very powerful plugin that offers a complete solution to easy create custom fields for your pages and posts.

What are custom fields ?

If you go to a page in the dashboard, you'll see that the only place you can enter content (text, images, etc.) is in a WYSIWYG text area. (or... if in some chapters ago you removed it from inside `function.php` you just won't have anything).

The goal here is to have as many inputs (fields) that the user can fill with text, or upload an image, set a link, etc. as we need for our project.

Think of this hero section of a landing page :

![alt text](image-1.png)

There is a title `Açaí du Nord` that I must echo in a specific part of my code (in this case, my `h1`)

There is a subtitle `L'authentique açaí du nord du Brésil` that I must echo in whatever tag I used fot the subtitle.

There is a button `Commander` that I must be able to set with this text, and associate it to a link text.

There is the hero image that I must be able to upload in order to echo its link text in my `img` tag. ...

Wouldn't it be nice to have separate fields where I can fill up individually all these information ?

Well... ACF allows you to do this in a very easy way!

There is a free and a pro version of ACF. Thankfully, BeCode gets you covered !

Download the zip file `advanced-custom-fields-pro-3` in this folder. (all plugins are zip files)

**ASSIGNMENT**

- Go ahead and install the ACF plugin.

- Then, find a way to create exactly these fields I mentioned (`title`, `subtitle`, `button` with a link to somewhere and an `image`)
- After you did it, fill the fields and echo them to your page. (You will have to get along with the functions provided by ACF : `the_field()`, `get_field()`, etc. as well as the ways to manipulate them)
- Make sure you implement these on the main page, not in the `header` or the `footer`
- Now, create a `repeater` field in order to create a list of fruits that you will display on your page.

At the end, it shoud look like something like this :

![alt text](image-5.png)

Depending on what you did in the last chapters it can be a little different, no problem ! The important here is to have :

- A working linked css file
- A working linked js file
- A header and footer separated from the main page.
- Custom fields linked to the `title`, `subtitle`, `link` (with url and displayed text), `image` and a list of items entered in a `repeater field`

This is how your dashboard could look like :

Good luck !

Note : the newest version of ACF is even better than the one used in this tutorial, allowing you to create Custom Post Types as well. We'll get there... ;)

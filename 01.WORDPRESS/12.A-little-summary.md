# A little summary

---

Oufff... Let's try to make sense on what we've been doing and make the transition to the next steps.

Here is a small recap of the concepts we tackled.

- WordPress is originally a **blog engine** that considers everything as a blog post.

<br/>

- That means... every post (or even page) has an author, a publication date, the ability for users to comment, etc.

  <br/>

- We can assign posts and pages to **templates** which are regular HTML pages in order to display these posts. But we often won't be displaying posts. Just a regular website page. Which brings us to the next point :

  <br/>

- Creating a regular website from scratch and use WordPress to power it as a CMS is a constant _hack_ to use the power of customization of WordPress without having to consider it a blog.

  <br/>

- This power comes from the ability of inserting content: text, images, etc., keep them in sync with a database, edit them, store media, etc. from a single Dashboard.

  <br/>

- More than the regular WYSIWYG you can use for a blog post, we have also the possibility to create custom fields and name them in order to have a proper _editing structure_ in our dashboard. (A plugin such as ACF is wonderfully easy and usefull to that).

  <br/>

- If we are doing a simple "showcase" website, we can simply use custom templates with WordPress pages with custom fields and a menu for multiple pages.

  <br/>

- But often we will need a little bit more complexity, like "single pages" for a specific topic (articles, specifc products, etc. ) What do I mean by that ?

  <br/>

  - Think of a movie platform that gatters a huge list of movies and when we click on one, we go to a "single page" of the movie you clicked. This is what I call a "single page". Well.. if you have a thousand movies, of course you won't be creating a thousand templates and pages for each one.
    <br/>

  - You will create a single template and use `posts` for each movie. Each post is a movie that will be displayed with the same template. You can even create a `Custom Post Type` called "Movies" for example. (we will see this very soon)
    <br/>

- Also, authentication can be done using the author profiles we have for the "blog" that WordPress is.

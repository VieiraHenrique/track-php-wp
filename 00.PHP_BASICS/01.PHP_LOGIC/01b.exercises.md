**Let's do an exercise !**

---

**1.**

Given this associative array, output what is demanded :

```php

$cities_by_country = [
    "Brussels" => "Belgium",
    "LiÃ¨ge" => "Belgium",
    "Paris" => "France",
    "Charleroi" => "Belgium",
    "Rome" => "Italy",
    "Nice" => "France",
    "Rio de Janeiro" => "Brazil",
    "Antwerp" => "Belgium",

]
```

Output a list (ul > li) of all the cities located in Belgium from this array.

Use a combination of loop and conditional.

- For that, go learn first how to imbricate PHP with HTML
- Then, go find what the directives `endforeach` and `endif` do.

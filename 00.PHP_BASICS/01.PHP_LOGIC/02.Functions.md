# Functions

---

Same old, same old...

Here is the syntax of functions in php (almost exactly the same as JavaScript). There is just one handy directive that we don't find in JavaScipt (`global`)

```php

function sum($num1, $num2)
{
    return $num1 + $num2;
}

echo sum(4, 9); // 13

```

Remember the `scope` concept ?

If you declare a variable inside a function, you don't have access to it outside this function. Same thing in PHP.

But... ! In JavaScript, if you declare a variable in the global scope, you HAVE access to this variable inside any function. Not in PHP.

You have to "declare" the variable again inside the function telling you are using the value from the global scope. So... if you do this :

```php
$x = 4;

function echo_some_stuff()
{
    echo $x; // This will throw an error because $x doesn't exist inside the function.
}

```

... it won't work because `$x` doesn't exist in the scope of the function.

If you want to use `$x` from the global scope inside the function, you have to tell the function you are using it :

```php
$x = 4;

function echo_some_stuff()
{
    global $x;
    echo $x;
}

```

**Solution**

---

This one might deserve a solution :

```php
<?php

$cities_by_country = [
    "Brussels" => "Belgium",
    "LiÃ¨ge" => "Belgium",
    "Paris" => "France",
    "Charleroi" => "Belgium",
    "Rome" => "Italy",
    "Nice" => "France",
    "Rio de Janeiro" => "Brazil",
    "Antwerp" => "Belgium",
]; ?>

<ul>
    <?php foreach ($cities_by_country as $city => $country) : ?>

        <?php if ($country === "Belgium") : ?>

            <li>
                <?php echo $city ?>
            </li>

        <?php endif; ?>

    <?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```

See ? Don't worry about opening and closing PHP tags between HTML elements. This happens all the time !

The `endforeach` and `endif` are little helpers to not loose yourself in the brackets.

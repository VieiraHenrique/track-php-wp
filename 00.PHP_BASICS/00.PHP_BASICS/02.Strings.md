# Strings

---

How do we handle `strings` in PHP ?

```php
$my_string = "Hello World";

echo $my_string[4]; // Prints " "
echo $my_string[5]; // Prints "W"

```

(Nothing too different from other languages)

```php
$my_string_one = "Hello";
$my_string_two = "World";

echo $my_string_one . " " . $my_string_two; // Prints "Hello World"

// Notice that the space must be concatenated as well.
```

PHP has a very extensive collection of native functions that can retrieve information and manipulate all kinds of data. Thankfully, the official website of PHP has a very [complete documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php) about all of them.

There are a lot ! But with time you'll get to know and understand each one of them (or at least the most important ones)

Let's see some of them (you can infer what they do from their names... `strtoupper` for example stands for `string to uppercase`)

```php
$my_string = "Hello World";

echo strlen($my_string); // Prints 11 (the lenght of the string)

echo str_replace("Hello", "Hi", $my_string); // Prints "Hi World"

echo substr($my_string, 2, 4); // Prints "llo"

echo strtolower($my_string); // Prints "hello world"

echo strtoupper($my_string); // Prints "HELLO WORLD"

echo str_word_count($my_string); // Prints 2

echo strrev($my_string); // Prints "dlroW olleH"

$my_string_two = "     hello there   ";

echo trim($my_string_two); // Prints "hello there"

```

etc... etc... etc...
There is surely one function to any manipulation of strings you can think of.

**Let's do a little exercise :**

---

**1**

Given the existing code at the end, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?

`$a = "3"; $b = "8";`

At the end :

The variable `$a` should hold the value "8".

And the variable `$b` should hold the value "3".

When the code is run, it should output on the browser:

```
a is 8
b is 3
```

Copy the bellow code into your php file and refresh it in the browser.

- Do NOT change any of the existing code.

- You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.

Copy this code :

```php
<?php

$a = "3";
$b = "8";

/***********Do not change the code above ðŸ‘†*******/
//Write your code here :



/***********Do not change the code below ðŸ‘‡*******/

echo "a is " . $a;
echo "<br/>";
echo "b is " . $b;

?>
```

This is the occasion to understand two concepts on PHP :

- Concatenation is done with a `.`
- If you want to break a line on what is shown, you will have to echo an html tag `<br/>`. Do you get why ? You will be "printing" to the HTML the br tag, that will be interpreted by your browser.
